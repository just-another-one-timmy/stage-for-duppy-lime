"Stage for Duppy Lime" is the static site generator that I'm going to use for my site - http://iaro.jp
It's a static site generator for people with small brain.
The name stands for *sta*tic site *ge*nerator *for* *du*mb *p*eo*p*l *li*ke *me*.

Jekyll, Octopress and etc are all great.
But it's too hard to setup and use.
I want to have something dumb simple.
